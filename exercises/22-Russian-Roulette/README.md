# `22` Russian Roulette 

Have you ever played Russian Roulette? It's super fun! 

If you make it (wuuuahahahaha).

The revolver gun has only 6 slots for bullets. You insert one bullet in one of the slots, spin the revolver chamber to make the game random, nobody knows the bullet position.

FIRE!!!....... are you dead?

## :pencil: Instructions:
The game is almost working.
* Please fill the function **fireGun** to make the game work (compare the bullet position against the chamber position.)

### :bulb: HINT:
- If the bullet position matches the chamber position, the function fireGun() should return `"You're dead!`
- If the bullet position doesn't match the chamber position, the function fireGun() should return `"Keep playing!`
