# `13` How Much Does the Wedding Cost?

Here is a table of prices of a wedding catering company:

| No. of people | Price |
|:---|---:|
| Up to 50 people  | $4,000 |
| Up to 100 people | $10,000 |
| Up to 200 people | $15,000  |
| More than 200 people | $20,000 |

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Write an **algorithm** (a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer) that prompts the user for the number of people attending their wedding and prints the corresponding price to the console.

_For example, if the user says that 20 people are attending the wedding, the console should display a price of $4,000 dollars._

**Divide and Conquer** - breaking a problem up into smaller pieces that are easier to solve

### ðŸ’¡ Hint:
* Use a conditional `if...else` statement to divide your code and assign the variable `price` to the appropriate value.
