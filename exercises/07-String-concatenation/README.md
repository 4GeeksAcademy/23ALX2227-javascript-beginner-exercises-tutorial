One of Javascript's main objectives is to generate HTML code; concatenation comes in handy because you can create and add to existing HTML strings. To concatenate strings, we use the + (plus) operator, for example:

var one = 'a';
var two = 'b';
console.log(one+two); //this will print 'ab' on the console.

Instructions
Set the values for myVar1 and myVar2 so the code prints 'Hello World' in the console.
