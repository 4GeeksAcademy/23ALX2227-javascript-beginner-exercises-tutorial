# `10` Creating Your First Function

Function definitions have a number of parts to them:

```js
function function name (param1, param2, ...) {
    return param1 + param2
}
```
Functions begin with the **keyword** `function`

The `function name` is the name of the function

`(param1, param2, ...)` are the **parameters** (variables) required by the function.  They can be integers, strings, doubles, or any combination thereof.  You can have zero or more parameters in a given function.  Parameters are assigned **arguments**, which are the user's input.

Within the curly braces `{...}` is the function body.  Here is where the arguments are processed and some sort of output is provided. Output can include returning a value (as shown in the example above), printing to the console, calling another function, etc.

## :pencil: Instructions:

The function **addNumbers()** is supposed to return the sum of 2 given numbers.
* Complete the needed code inside of the function to make it behave as expected.

* The exercise should print the number `7` to the console.

### ðŸ’¡ Hint:

The function is receiving 2 arguments (stored in the parameters `a` and `b`). Provide the necessary code within the function body that will calculate the sum of these two arguments. The function should return the result of the operation as well.

### :scroll: Note:

*For more practice with functions, there is a specific repl.it class about functions created by 4Geeks Academy that has over 20 incremental exercises.*
