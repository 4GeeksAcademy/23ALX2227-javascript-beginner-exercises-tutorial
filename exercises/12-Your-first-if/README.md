# `12` Your First "If" Statement

Your journey has now reached a crucial point: conditional statements. Conditionals allow a user to navigate through a program based upon their inputs. This is the beginnings of computer logic.

The current application has a prompt asking how much money the user has.


## :pencil: Instructions:
Once the user inputs an amount, one of the following responses will be printed to the console:

* If the user has more than $100, we answer: `"Give me your money!"`
* If the user has more than $50, we answer: `"Buy me some coffee, you cheapskate!"`
* If the user has less than or equal to $50, we answer: `"You are a poor guy, go away!"`

### ðŸ’¡ Hint:
* Use an `if...else` statement to check the value of the `total` variable.
* You can use `else if` within your conditional, if needed.
* Print the corresponding message to the console.
