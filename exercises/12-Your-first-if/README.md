# `12` Your First "If" Statement

Your journey has now reached a crucial point: conditional statements. Conditionals allow a user to navigate through a program based upon their inputs. This is the beginnings of computer logic.

The current application has a prompt asking `How many km are left to go?`


## :pencil: Instructions:
Once the user inputs an amount, one of the following responses will be printed to the console:

* If the user has more than $100, we answer: `"Are we there yet?"`
* If the user has more than $50, we answer: `"We'll be there in 5 minutes"`
* If the user has less than or equal to $50, we answer: `"I'm parking, I see you right now"`


### ðŸ’¡ Hint:
* Use an `if...else` statement to check the value of the `total` variable.
* You can use `else if` within your conditional, if needed.
* Print the corresponding message to the console.
