The current application is prompting asking how much money the user has. Once the user inputs the amount, we need to console.log one of the following answers:

If the user has more than $100, we answer: "Give me your money!"
If the user has more than $50, we answer: "Buy me some coffee you cheap!"
If the user has less or equal than $50, we answer: "You are a poor guy, go away!"

Hint: 
Use an If/else statement to check the value of the "total" variable.
